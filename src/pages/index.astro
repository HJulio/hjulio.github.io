    <p>Hi! I'm Héctor.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer from Spain, passionate about building backend
      systems that run quietly and unnoticed in the background (that means they
      work).
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://emailmeter.com">Email Meter</a>, I handle vast amounts
      of real-time data daily using Python, BigQuery, Dataflow, and AI for
      automated categorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love analog photography — feel free to explore my work in <a
        href="/gallery">/gallery</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>🙋🏻‍♂️ 🇪🇸 ❤️ 🛠️ 🐍 📷</p>
