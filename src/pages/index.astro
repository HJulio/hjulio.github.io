    <p>Hi! I'm Héctor.</p>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer from Spain and I love to build things that runs in
      the backgroud (a way to say backend developer).
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://emailmeter.com">Email Meter</a>, where I currently
      work, I manage tons of real-time data every day with tools like Python,
      BigQuery, Dataflow and IA models for automatic categorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love analog photography. You can check my photos in <a href="/gallery"
        >/gallery</a
      >.
